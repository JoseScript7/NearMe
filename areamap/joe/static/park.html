                One of my most cherished and vivid memories from childhood takes me back to the Childrens Park in Chennai. It was a day filled with laughter and excitement as my dad, my sister, and I explored every corner of the park. But little did I know, while lost in the fun of the rides, I would soon feel a mix of fear and bravery that I would never forget.

                As I joyfully ran from one ride to the next, I suddenly realized I had wandered too far from my dad and sister. In an instant, the bustling park felt overwhelmingly huge, and panic set in. Tears welled up as I searched around, but my family was nowhere in sight. Yet, somehow, amidst the confusion, a spark of courage rose within me. Gathering my little 2nd-grade self together, I went straight to the entrance and confidently approached the police there. With all the determination I could muster, I explained that it was my parents who were missing, and I proudly shared their names and phone number, hoping they wouldd find their way back to me!

                Looking back, this memory is more than just a funny childhood story it is one of those precious, deeply ingrained moments that made Chennai Childrens Park feel magical and unforgettable.
